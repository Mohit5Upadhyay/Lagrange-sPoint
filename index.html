                        <span class="lp">Lagrange point 1 (L1)</span> is one of the five Lagrange points in the
                        Earth-Sun system. It is located
                        along the line defined by the two large bodies (in this case, the Earth and the Sun) beyond the
                        smaller of the two (the Earth). Specifically, L1 is located on the line defined by the two large
                        masses and lies outside the smaller mass orbit.
                        <br>
                        From the perspective of Earth and the Sun, L1 remains approximately in the same position
                        relative to the Earth, maintaining a fixed geometric configuration. This property makes L1 a
                        suitable location for certain types of space missions and observations.
                        <br>
                        Various space missions, such as the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Wilkinson
                        Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), have been placed at the L1 point to provide a constant view
                        of the Sun or to conduct observations unobstructed by the Earth. L1 is also a potential location
                        for future space telescopes and other space-based instruments.
                        <br>
                        To stay at L1, a spacecraft typically needs to perform periodic station-keeping maneuvers
                        because gravitational influences from the Earth, the Moon, and other celestial bodies, as well
                        as solar radiation pressure, can perturb its orbit.

                        <span class="lp">Lagrange point 2 (L2)</span> often denoted as L2, is another one of the five
                        Lagrange points in a two-body
                        system, such as the Earth-Sun system. Like other Lagrange points, L2 is a location in space
                        where the gravitational forces of two large bodies (in this case, the Earth and the Sun) and the
                        centrifugal force felt by a smaller object balance out, allowing the smaller object to maintain
                        a relatively stable position.
                        <br>
                        Specifically, L2 is located along the line defined by the two large masses (the Earth and the
                        Sun) but on the opposite side of the smaller mass (the Earth) from the larger mass. In other
                        words, if you draw a line through the center of the Earth and the Sun and continue that line
                        outward, L2 would be located on the side of the Earth opposite to the Sun.
                        <br>
                        L2 has potential applications for space observations and missions. For instance, it is an
                        attractive location for space telescopes that need an unobstructed view of the universe, as it
                        allows for continuous observations without interference from the Earth. The James Webb Space
                        Telescope (JWST), which is the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, is planned to be
                        positioned at the L2 point to observe the universe in infrared wavelengths.

                        <span class="lp">Lagrange point 3 (L3)</span> often denoted as L3, is one of the five Lagrange
                        points in a two-body system,
                        such as the Earth-Sun system. Like other Lagrange points, L3 is a location in space where the
                        gravitational forces of two large bodies (in this case, the Earth and the Sun) and the
                        centrifugal force felt by a smaller object balance out, allowing the smaller object to maintain
                        a relatively stable position.
                        <br>
                        L3 is located along the line defined by the two large masses (the Earth and the Sun) but on the
                        opposite side of the larger mass (the Sun) from the smaller mass (the Earth). In other words, if
                        you draw a line through the center of the Earth and the Sun and continue that line outward, L3
                        would be located on the side of the Sun opposite to the Earth.
                        <br>
                        Unlike Lagrange Points 1 and 2, L3 is less commonly used for space missions and observations.
                        This is mainly because it is dynamically unstable; small perturbations can cause objects at L3
                        to drift away from their positions over time. Therefore, maintaining a stable orbit at L3
                        requires active control.
                        <br>
                        While L3 itself may not be as practically useful as some other Lagrange points, the concept of
                        Lagrange points in general is valuable for space mission planning.

                        <span class="lp">Lagrange point 4 (L4)</span> often denoted as L4, is one of the five Lagrange
                        points in a two-body system,
                        such as the Earth-Sun system. Like all Lagrange points, L4 represents a location in space where
                        the gravitational forces of two large bodies (in this case, the Earth and the Sun) and the
                        centrifugal force experienced by a smaller object balance out, allowing the smaller object to
                        maintain a relatively stable position.
                        <br>
                        L4 is located along the orbit of the smaller mass (in this case, the Earth), approximately 60
                        degrees ahead of the smaller mass as it orbits the larger mass (the Sun). It forms an
                        equilateral triangle with the larger and smaller masses.
                        <br>
                        What makes Lagrange Point 4 interesting is that, due to its position in the orbit, it is
                        sometimes referred to as the "leading" Lagrange point. This means that as the smaller mass
                        (Earth) orbits the larger mass (Sun), L4 remains about 60 degrees ahead of the smaller mass
                        along its orbit.
                        <br>
                        L4 is dynamically stable, meaning that objects placed at this Lagrange point can remain in a
                        relatively fixed position with respect to the Earth and the Sun without the need for constant
                        adjustments. This stability makes L4 an interesting location for certain types of space
                        missions, including those involving observations of the Sun and space weather. However, as of my
                        last knowledge update in January 2022.

                        <span class="lp">Lagrange point 5 (L5)</span> is one of the five Lagrange points in a two-body
                        system,
                        such as the Earth-Sun system. Like other Lagrange points, L5 is a location in space where the
                        gravitational forces of two large bodies (in this case, the Earth and the Sun) and the
                        centrifugal force experienced by a smaller object balance out, allowing the smaller object to
                        maintain a relatively stable position.
                        <br>
                        L5 is located along the orbit of the smaller mass (in this case, the Earth), approximately 60
                        degrees behind the smaller mass as it orbits the larger mass (the Sun). Like L4, L5 forms an
                        equilateral triangle with the larger and smaller masses.
                        <br>
                        Similar to Lagrange Point 4, Lagrange Point 5 is dynamically stable. Objects placed at L5 can
                        maintain a relatively fixed position with respect to the Earth and the Sun without the need for
                        frequent adjustments.
                        <br>
                        One interesting aspect of Lagrange Points 4 and 5 is that they are sometimes referred to as the
                        "leading" and "trailing" Lagrange points, respectively, because they lead or trail the smaller
                        mass in its orbit around the larger mass.
                        <br>
                        While Lagrange Points 4 and 5 are dynamically stable, they have not been as extensively utilized
                        as some other Lagrange points in space missions. However, they are considered in certain mission
                        planning scenarios, and their potential applications in future space exploration and observation
                        missions continue to be explored.
